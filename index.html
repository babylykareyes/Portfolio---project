            Chess is an enjoyable activity that let's me improve my powers of concentration. <br>
            But chess is not everything: we should all try to experience life in its fullest. <br>
            One thing I learned from playing chess,"Be Humble of what you do and what you can do, <br> Let the Actions/ Games speak".

            Always cautious about who to trust, I know that not everyone
            has a pure intentions. Careful about who I keep in corner, but those who gain my 
            trust can expect nothing but loyalty from me.

            Photography gives me creative fulfillment. It helps me express myself artstically, and that's a wonderful thing.
            Photography is a major part of my life, one of my major passion. It gives me something to do and learn about my 
            spare time and add up to many thousands of hours of enjoyment.
